# MQTT-based-remote-communication
This project is completely written in Python programming language.
It has used the MQTT library of python.
This project can be used to communicate between two IoT devices without human control.


## Inspiration
It started when I was learning IOT first time.
## What it does
It basically setup a automatic communication process between two or more IOT devices and it does not require human control. It is very fast in service as MQTT protocol is used in it.
It is also a two way communication protocol.
## How we built it
I created it using python and its paho-mqtt library. 
## Challenges we ran into
The main challenge was of data protection but I after some modification into it, I get the solution for it by using a random channel for communication each time.
## What we learned
It made me to think about data security and need for automatic communication among IoT devices.
## What's next for MQTT based remote communication
The next step is to develop some data encryption techniques to encrypt the data at sender device and decryption at receiver side.
